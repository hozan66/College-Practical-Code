		It's normal text: CSS Level 2 needed 9 years, from August 2002 to June 2011 to reach the Recommendation status. This was due to the fact that a few secondary features held back the whole specification. In order to accelerate the standardization of non-problematic features, the CSS Working Group of the W3C, in a decision referred as the Beijing doctrine, divided CSS in smaller components called modules . Each of these modules is now an independent part of the language and moves towards standardization at its own pace. While some modules are already W3C Recommendations, other still are early Working Drafts. New modules are also added when new needs are identified.
